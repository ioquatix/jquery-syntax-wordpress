jQuery.Syntax is an extremely fast and lightweight syntax highlighter.

== Description ==

jQuery.Syntax is an extremely fast and lightweight syntax highlighter. It has dynamic loading of syntax source files and integrates cleanly using CSS or modelines.

This WordPress plugin provides syntax highlighting using jQuery.Syntax, supporting a wide range of popular languages. Wrap code blocks with <code>&lt;pre class="syntax brush-{language}"&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/pre&gt;</code> where <code>{language}</code> is a jQuery.Syntax supported brush.

If the code has already been escaped (i.e. characters such as &lt;, &gt;, have been converted to html entities), then add <code>escaped</code> into the class list: <code>&lt;pre class="syntax escaped brush-{language}"&gt;</code>. This will prevent the filter from doing this conversion automatically.
